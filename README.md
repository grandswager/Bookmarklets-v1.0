# Bookmarklets-v1.0
Some bookmarklets lol.

# What are bookmarklets?
Bookmarklets are strips of code that inject to the current website that you are on.

# How to use bookmarklets
Copy the code, then in your bookmarks section you right click, then select "add page", and in "name" enter what it's called and in "URL" put the code.

To use the bookmarklet, just click on it when it's supposed to work.

# DISCLAIMER
I did not create some of these.
